    Your ONLY task is to cluster the {n_responses} responses into buckets based on their reasoning algorithm, including both the overall strategy and the methods used at key intermediate steps.

    **INPUT FORMAT:** You will receive:
    1) A "Context" describing the task.
    2) A numbered list of Responses from 1 to {n_responses}. Each response contains a reasoning process and final answer. 
       Note: Responses may or may not explicitly state their strategy; you must infer the strategy by analyzing the mathematical steps taken.

    **CLUSTERING CRITERIA:**
    (1) Macro-strategy: The overall conceptual framework (e.g., recursion vs infinite series; prime factorization vs gcd-based formula).
    (2) Micro-strategy: The specific method used to resolve key intermediate steps. Examples include: how absolute values are removed (± case split vs squaring), how intervals are partitioned, or how a basis is chosen.

    **CLUSTERING RULES:** - Cluster strictly based on logic and approach. NOT on wording, tone, or formatting.  
    - Two responses share a cluster_id IF AND ONLY IF they use the same macro-strategy AND the same micro-strategy at every key step.
    - Arithmetic errors do NOT create new clusters if the underlying logic is identical.
    - **SPECIAL CLUSTER 100:** You MUST assign `cluster_id: 100` to any response that is:
        * Gibberish (random characters, nonsense strings).
        * Irrelevant to the math problem (off-topic text).
        * Non-mathematical reasoning (e.g., writing code to solve it instead of math, or making a random guess at the final answer without logical steps).
        * Excessive repetition (e.g., repeating the final answer multiple times at the end of the response).

    **OUTPUT RULES (STRICT):** 1. Respond ONLY with a JSON object. No text outside the JSON.
    2. The JSON must contain exactly {n_responses} keys: "1", "2", ..., "{n_responses}".  
    3. The value for each key must be:  
        "chain_of_thought": "Macro: [short description]. Micro: [short description]."
        "cluster_id": integer.
    4. chain_of_thought must be concise and avoid repeating the actual calculations.

    **Few-Shot Example 1:**

    **Context:**
    What is the smallest value of x such that |5x - 1| = |3x + 2|?

    **Responses:**
    1. We can split this into two cases: 5x - 1 = 3x + 2 or 5x - 1 = -(3x + 2). Solving the first gives 2x = 3 so x = 1.5. The second gives 8x = -1 so x = -0.125.
    2. The expression 5x-1 changes sign at 1/5, and 3x+2 changes at -2/3. For x < -2/3, we have -(5x-1) = -(3x+2). For -2/3 < x < 1/5, we have -(5x-1) = 3x+2. Solve -(5x - 1) = 3x + 2 for the range, yielding x = -0.125.
    3. Using the property that |a|=|b| implies a=b or a=-b, we get 5x-1 = 3x+2 (x=1.5) and 5x-1 = -3x-2 (x=-0.125). So the answer is x = -0.125
    4. To get rid of the absolute values, square both sides: (5x - 1)^2 = (3x + 2)^2. This expands to 25x^2 - 10x + 1 = 9x^2 + 12x + 4. Solve 16x^2 - 22x - 3 = 0. So, x = -1/8, 3/2. Final answer is x = -1/8
    5. Either 5x - 1 = 3x + 2 or 5x - 1 = -3x - 2. This leads to x = 3/2 and x = 0. So, final answer is x = 0.
    6. I think the answer is probably 0 or maybe 1.5. 
    7. 基金份额；份额；部分. asdf qwer zxcv 9999 ---- ??? Let's write Python to check each x from -10 to 10: `if abs(5*x-1) == abs(3*x+2): print(x)`. The answer is -0.125.

    **Few-Shot Example 2:**

    **Context:**
    What is the least common multiple of 72 and 96?

    **Responses:**
    1. 72 = 2^3 * 3^2. 96 = 2^5 * 3^1. To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor present: 2^5 * 3^2 = 32 * 9 = 288.
    2. Prime factors of 72: 2, 2, 2, 3, 3. Prime factors of 96: 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3. The union of these sets is five 2s and two 3s. Total: 276.
    3. First find the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm: 96 = 72(1) + 24; 72 = 24(3) + 0. GCD is 24. LCM is (72 * 96) / 24.
    4. 72 = 8*9, 96 = 8*12. The answer is 288. The answer is 288. The answer is 288. The answer is 288.
